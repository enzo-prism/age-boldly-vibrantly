        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn's work has transformed our understanding of heart disease. A distinguished surgeon and researcher at the Cleveland Clinic, he has conducted a long running study on the effects of nutrition on heart health. His findings are remarkable: a Whole Food, Plant-Based, oil free diet not only can prevent the progression of coronary heart disease —it can actually reverse it.

        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          By eliminating meat, dairy, oils, and highly processed foods, and focusing instead on nutrient-dense plant foods–especially leafy greens—-Dr. Esselstyn's patients have restored blood flow, reduced inflammation, and, in many cases avoided the need for surgery or medication. His message is clear and compelling: the most powerful tool for protecting your heart is your daily food choices. It is not a quick fix—-it is a lifestyle, and one that offers the potential for profound healing and vitality.

            At Rebellious Aging, I deeply honor Dr Esselstyn's evidence– -based approach and incorporate his principles and guidance into my lifestyle. While each of us has unique needs, I believe his work offers a powerful foundation for anyone seeking long term health and vitality—especially as we age. Embracing a WFPB lifestyle is not about restriction—it is about liberation.
